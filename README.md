# OOP Tasks - From Beginner to Advanced

This repository contains 10 comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming tasks that progress from basic concepts to advanced design patterns.

> **Note:** These tasks were designed by Mustafa Elsherbiny and written with AI assistance.

## 🌐 Language Support

**These tasks can be completed in any OOP language:** Java, C#, PHP, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, or any other object-oriented programming language.

- Adapt the syntax and naming conventions to your chosen language
- Use equivalent data structures (Lists/Arrays, Maps/Dictionaries, etc.)
- Some advanced concepts like generics, events/delegates, or interfaces may have language-specific equivalents
- Code examples are provided in pseudocode or language-agnostic format

## 📚 Level 1: Beginner Tasks (1-4)
**Focus:** Basic classes, objects, methods, and collections

### Task 1: Library Management System

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Level 1** if you're new to OOP
2. **Progress sequentially** through the tasks
3. **Complete all bonus challenges** for deeper learning
4. **Review the learning goals** before starting each task
5. **Test your code thoroughly** with the provided examples

## 🎓 Learning Path

```
Level 1 (Beginner) → Level 2 (Intermediate) → Level 3 (Advanced)
    Tasks 1-4            Tasks 5-7               Tasks 8-10
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Read the entire task** before starting to code
- **Plan your class structure** before implementing
- **Test incrementally** as you build each class
- **Use meaningful names** for variables and methods
- **Add comments** to explain complex logic
- **Complete the example usage** to verify your implementation
- **Try the bonus challenges** to deepen your understanding

## 📊 Concepts Covered

| Concept | Tasks |
|---------|-------|
| Classes & Objects | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| Inheritance | 5, 7 |
| Polymorphism | 5, 7, 10 |
| Interfaces | 6, 9, 10 |
| Abstract Classes | 5, 10 |
| Enums/Constants | 6, 10 |

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **Generics** are called templates in C++, type parameters in other languages
- **Events/Delegates** can be implemented with observers, callbacks, or listeners
- **Query operations** (LINQ in C#, Streams in Java, array methods in JavaScript, etc.)
- **Enums** may be implemented as classes, constants, or native enum types depending on your language
- **Interfaces** may be called protocols, traits, or abstract base classes in some languages

Good luck on your OOP journey!
